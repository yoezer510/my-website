    <h2>National Dress</h2>
    <p>
      The national dress of Bhutan is the <strong>Gho</strong> for men and the <strong>Kira</strong> for women. 
      These garments are not only symbols of cultural pride but are also legally required to be worn in schools, 
      government offices, and on formal occasions.

    <h2>Cuisine</h2>
    <p>
      Bhutanese cuisine is known for its simplicity and use of fresh, local ingredients. 
      The national dish is <strong>Ema Datshi</strong>, a spicy mix of chilies and cheese. 
      Rice, red rice in particular, is a staple, often served with vegetables and meat stews.

    <h2>Arts</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Thirteen Traditional Arts of Bhutan</strong> (Zorig Chusum) include painting, 
      sculpture, wood carving, weaving, and paper making. These crafts are taught in specialized schools 
      and are an essential part of preserving Bhutanâ€™s cultural identity.

  <h2>Dance</h2>
  <p>
    Dance is an essential part of Bhutanese festivals and religious ceremonies. 
    The famous <strong>masked dances</strong> performed during <em>Tsechus</em> 
    are not only entertainment but also spiritual practices meant to bless onlookers, 
    protect them from evil, and teach Buddhist values. 
    Each movement and costume carries symbolic meaning.

  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>
    Bhutanese music reflects the harmony between spirituality and daily life. 
    Traditional instruments such as the <em>dramyen</em> (lute), <em>lingm</em> (flute), 
    and <em>zhungdra</em> (long, traditional songs) are performed at religious and social events. 
    Music often carries stories, teachings, and expressions of joy.

    <h2>Language</h2>
    <p>
      The national language of Bhutan is <strong>Dzongkha</strong>, though many regional dialects are spoken 
      throughout the country. Language is a vital part of Bhutanese tradition, helping to preserve cultural heritage 
      and connect communities across diverse regions.
